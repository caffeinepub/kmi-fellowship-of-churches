  "summary": "Implemented a new \"Ministry Seals\" section on the Ministries page with a responsive grid and clickable lightbox-style dialog for viewing larger images, plus a utility for stable/encoded public asset URLs. However, the diff does not show the required static image assets (including the listed duplicates) being added to the frontend static assets, and the content catalog currently references only 4 images rather than the full required set.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Ensure all uploaded seal-related image assets are included in the frontend as static files and referenced using stable public paths so they load reliably in production builds.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code that references images under `/assets/ministry-seals/...` and a URL-encoding helper, but it does not show the actual image files being added to the frontend static assets, nor does it include references for the full required list (including the -1 and -2 duplicates). Without those files present, the AC about directly loading each listed file by URL in production cannot be verified from this diff.",
