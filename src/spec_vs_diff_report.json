  "summary": "The diff implements substantial visual restyling across global CSS tokens, nav/footer, hero, buttons, typography, and adds decorative flourishes. However, required static image assets are not shown as added, and at least one component appears to change user-facing page content (Upcoming Events), which violates the styling-only constraint. The palette also introduces prominent purple tokens/usage that may conflict with the “no blue/purple-dominant theme” constraint.",

      "reason": "HomePage references the edited hero image path, but the diff shows no added static asset files, so the required edited image is not evidenced as present in the change set.",
