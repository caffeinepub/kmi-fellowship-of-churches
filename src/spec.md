# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Correct the “Armor Bearers” label on Get Involved and refresh Ministries imagery to a modern, youthful look.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “Ministry Auxiliaries” item title on `/get-involved` from “Altar/Alter Bearers” to “Armor Bearers”.
- Replace outdated-looking images used on the Ministries page (including the “Ministry Seals” section) with newly generated, modern, vibrant visuals stored in `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and update frontend references to use them.

**User-visible outcome:** On Get Involved, the Ministry Auxiliaries grid shows “Armor Bearers” with no remaining “Altar/Alter Bearers” text, and the Ministries page displays updated, contemporary imagery with a youthful, vibrant feel.
