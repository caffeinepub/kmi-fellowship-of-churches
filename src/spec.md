# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restyle the site with a more vibrant, celebratory Black Apostolic & Holiness aesthetic that remains welcoming to a mixed-denomination audience, applied consistently across all pages without changing any content, routes, or navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global theme styling (palette, typography, section surfaces, cards, buttons, links, and special blocks) to a near-black base with warm gold accents and vibrant highlights, applied consistently site-wide.
- Revise Tailwind theme tokens and component utility classes in `frontend/src/index.css` to support the new palette and improve accessible contrast for text, links, buttons, and nav states.
- Restyle the header and footer (background treatment, borders, hover/active link styling) to match the updated theme while keeping all routes, labels, and behavior unchanged.
- Enhance the Home page hero styling (overlay/contrast) to better fit the new aesthetic while keeping the existing hero layout and CTAs intact.
- Introduce at least one reusable decorative “flair” element (e.g., ornamental divider and/or subtle texture overlay) and apply it sparingly to key areas like the hero, section headers, and special blocks; serve decorative assets as static frontend assets.

**User-visible outcome:** The site appears richer, warmer, and more celebratory with consistent near-black + gold + vibrant accents across pages; navigation and content remain the same, but the header/footer, hero, and key blocks feel more polished and distinctive while staying readable and accessible.
